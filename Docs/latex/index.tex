This is my implementation of ring buffer. It was primary created as a part of bigger project, but I decided to share it with everyone. ~\newline
 It was created for use with S\+T\+M32\+L151 peripherals (U\+A\+RT, S\+PI). Then I used it on S\+T\+M32\+F4, S\+T\+M32\+F3, and P\+I\+C18F platforms without problems. ~\newline
 It implements two types of work. ~\newline
 One is opration on an array pointer, which gives an ability to create multiple buffers with different size, but the user must provide an array for buffer. ~\newline
 Second is with fixed size array, where user only has to create buffer structure, bute every buffer have the same size.
